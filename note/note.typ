= Introduction

== Aim

- An introduction to the functioning of modern deep learning systems.
- Learn the underlying concepts of modern deep learning systems.
	- Automatic differentiation
	- Neural network architectures
	- Optimization
	- Efficient operations on systems like GPUs
- Build a deep learning library from scratch.

== Why studying DL Systems?

+ To build deep learning systems.
+ To use existing systems more effectively.
+ Deep learing systems are fun!

== Elements

- *Compose* multiple tensor operations to build modern machine learning models.
- *Transform* a sequence of operations (automatic differentiation).
- *Accelerate* computation via specialized hardware.
- *Extend* more hardware backends, more operators.
